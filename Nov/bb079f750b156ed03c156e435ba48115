1 November 2019 Government is saddened by the passing away of media giant, Xolani Gwala and sends its deepest condolences to his family and to the media fraternity as a whole. Gwala was a key figure in the media industry having worked as a journalist and presenter at various media entities. Xolani Gwala’s journalistic career began as a newsreader at Ukhozi FM and later P4 Radio in Durban. He hosted the PM Live talk show on SA FM, Asikhulume on SABC, SABC Africa and News Hour on SABC 3. He later moved to Talk Radio 702 as host of the station’s Afternoon Drive show. His dedication to his profession and work ethic had earned him honour, respect, and recognition in the industry. Xolani was known for asking the difficult questions and this bears testament to the advanced media freedom and freedom of expression in our country. His passing has made the media fraternity poorer and is a loss to our nation. He left an indelible mark on South African radio as he was well known for being at the forefront of issues and bringing the story closer to the people. Xolani Gwala’s death comes at a time when the country commemorates 25 years of media freedom. He has contributed immensely to the transformational media approach in informing, education and entertaining. South Africa has come a long way and has created an enabling environment for free and vibrant media industry. Since the advent of democracy, government has ensured that freedom of expression and freedom of the press, and other media are enshrined in our Constitution. These freedoms are an essential part of our democracy and we will continue to nurture and protect them.  Our commitment to freedom of expression and a free media remains steadfast, and we will continue to engage with media and the industry in a spirit of partnership.
