2 November 2019 Government congratulates the national rugby team, the mighty Springboks, for winning the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan. Equally, government extends its congratulations to the technical support team that worked with the Boks that led to the magnificent win. The #StrongerTogether team powered ahead in Yokohoma, beating England with a score of 32-12. This is our 3rd World Cup victory in just 25 years. As a young nation, we pride ourselves in the strides we have made in developing our sporting fraternity. We are particularly proud of our captain, Siyathanda Kolisi who is our first African captain to lead the team to a world cup victory. The euphoria created by the sterling performance of the Boks have brought together people of different races, cultures and walks of life and united them for a common purpose. Once again, sport has proven to be a critical part of knitting together the social fabric of our nation. Transformation in our sporting codes and at grassroots levels are vital to strengthening sports in the country. Government thanks the fans and all South Africans across the globe for their continuous support to the South African team through out the various stages of the World Cup. The united spirit displayed during this World Cup shows us that South Africa can overcome any challenge through determination and by working together. We are indeed #StrongerTogether.
