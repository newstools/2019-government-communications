26 September 2019 The year 2019 is a very special time for South Africa. It is the year in which we reflect on the journey of the last 25 years since the attainment of our hard-won freedom and democracy. We will remember the relief and exhilaration of the day of our freedom, the historic and defining moment at which we became a country at peace with itself and the world. As we mark this incredible milestone, whose attainment we share with the international community which stood by the oppressed majority, we should all work towards sustaining the momentum to build a society in which all South Africans enjoy their rights to life, dignity and freedom.
