9 September 2019 The escalating number of Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) cases in South Africa has prompted a call to action which was led by #TheTotalShutdown. The Presidential Gender- Based Violence and Femicide Summit sat on the 2nd November 2018 and produced a Declaration which entailed deliverables that must be taken forward and be implemented in dealing with the crisis of GBVF. An Interim Steering Committee was formed as per article 3 of the Declaration, with the mandate to draft a National Strategic Plan Framework and establish a Multi – Sector GBVF Council, which will be the Coordinating body that will champion the National GBVF work. The Draft National Strategic Plan is currently being with Provincial Consultations taking place since August 2019.  The schedule for the month of September is as follows:  Province Date Location Venue Contact Person Gauteng Consultation 09 September 2019 Vaal Sicelo HallJohan le Roux RdMeyerton Park (Farms)Meyerton Anele Kunene 067 732 2853 Gauteng Consultation 10 September 2019 Mabopane Mabopane Indoor Sports Centre, 8551 Mangope Road, Mabopane Mariam Mangera 076 927 0890 Gauteng Consultation 11 September 2019 Johannesburg TBC (Oxfam) Kwezilomso Mbandazayo 082 817 0097 North West Consultation 12 September 2019 Potchefstroom The Madiba Banquet Hall 104 River St. Potchefstroom 2520 Anele Kunene 067 732 2853 North West Consultation 13 September 2019 Taung Bapuduhucwane Traditional Council1417 Chief Court Village Taung Anele Kunene 067 732 2853 Free State Consultation 12 September 2019 QwaQwa Charles Mopeli Stadium Hall Mariam Mangera 076 927 0890 Free State Consultation 13 September 2019 Welkom Ferdi Meyer HallCorner Stateway and Tulbagh Street, Welkom Central, Welkom, 9459 Mariam Mangera 076 927 0890   RSVP: https://forms.gle/RHj6hA6a95JECUUu8 (Please Click on link and fill in form) OR send an email to:  admin@gbvf.org.za Enquiries:Ms Sibongile MthembuCell: 073 595 3773E-mail: Sibs@gbvf.org.za or nsp@igbvf.org
