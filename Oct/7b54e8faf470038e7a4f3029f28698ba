31 October 2019 Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster (JCPS) ministers will visit Manguzi border post in KwaZulu-Natal on Friday, 01 November 2019. This visit is a follow-up, following the visit  that JCPS Cluster ministers held in 2017 where they discovered that Manguzi area and the border line between KwaZulu-Natal and Mozambique was a hive of criminal activities including the smuggling of illicit goods, drugs, vehicle theft, human trafficking and rhino horn poaching. The visit will provide feedback on what was found to be the problems in 2017 and the progress made so far and it will also outline the plans to further end all illegal activities happening in the area.
