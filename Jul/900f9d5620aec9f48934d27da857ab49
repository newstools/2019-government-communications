1 July2019 Government urges all South Africans to play their part during #MandelaMonth through partnerships for effective, sustainable, collaborative interventions in five key focus areas: Education and Literacy, Food and Nutrition, Shelter, Sanitation and Active Citizenship. This #MandelaMonth is particularly symbolic as it coincides with the 25 Years of Democracy. Acting GCIS Director General, Phumla Williams said: “Madiba has made an indelible mark on our society, having overseen the transition from apartheid to a society built on the pillars of democracy and freedom. July is a heightened month of awareness but the practice and principles of Madiba should be emulated on a daily basis.  Let us embrace the opportunity to celebrate Nelson Mandela’s legacy, as it gives everyone the opportunity to make an imprint and change the lives of others.” During Mandela Month, government leaders are expected to engage in a number of activities aimed at inspiring change. “Likewise, government encourages all South Africans and people from all nations to heed the call of the Mandela Day campaign and take responsibility for transforming our societies,” added Williams. Anybody can get involved by logging onto the www.mandeladay.com, which provides access to the Mandela Day Global Network, the needs database and other tools. “Let us take action, inspire change, make everyday a Mandela Day, and in doing so change and create a better tomorrow. Positive change was the gift left to each individual by Nelson Mandela, but it can only become a living legacy if we play our part,” said Williams. Enquiries:  Ms Phumla Williams  Cell: 083 501 0139
